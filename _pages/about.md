I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [Australian Institute for Machine Learning](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/aiml/), funded by [Centre for Augmented Reasoning](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/aiml/car). I obtained my PhD degree at School of Computer Science, The University of Adelaide, under the supervision of [Prof. Chunhua Shen](https://cshen.github.io/). My current major research interests are about computer vision with its application on dense prediction(such as matting, segmentation) and data effcient learning(such as continual learning, unsupervised learning).
