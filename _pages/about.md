I am a final-year Ph.D. student majored in Computer Science with the University of Adelaide, under the supervision of [Prof. Chunhua Shen](https://cshen.github.io/). My research focuses on computer vision with its application on dense prediction, such as image matting, human matting, semantic segmentation, denoising. I am anticipated to graduate in 2022.
